#                           Solving Umbalanced Data by Classification

## The objective is to use the Random Forest Classifier to detect unbalanced data results.

## Work Steps:

1. import pandas, Train_test_splt, RandomForestClassifier, and SMOTe algorithms including Datasets.
2. Separate x and y.
3. Data training and testing.
4. Use SMOTE to handle imbalanced datasets.
5. Train the model.
6. Solution: the result is 99 percent accuracy.
