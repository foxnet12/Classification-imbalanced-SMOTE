#                           Solving Inbalanced Data by Classification

## the objective is to use Random Forest Classifier to detect inbalanced data result.

## Work Steps:

1. 1. import pandas, Train_test_splt, RandomForestClassifier, and SMOTe algorithms including Datasets.
2. 2. Separate x and y.
   3. Data training and testing.
   4. Use SMOTE to handle imbalanced datasets.
   5. Train the model.
   6. Solution: the result is 99 percent accuracy.
3.
